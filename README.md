nexus-check
===========

Ruby script utilizes Mechanize to poll the Nexus 4 (16GB) Google Play store to check if the phone has come back in stock.

Also hooks up with Twilio to send me a text so I can snap it up before it sells out again ;)

Installation
------------
* `gem install twilio-ruby`
* Create a text file called twilio-login.password with SID on the first line and the token on the second line.
